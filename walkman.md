title: Walkman Cassette Player 
year: 1979
caption:  This Sony Walkman portable tape player dates from the early 1980s. Originally introduced in 1979 as the Soundabout, two people could listen simultaneously while a small microphone permitted them to converse without removing their headsets. Powered by a 9-volt battery, the recorder sold well until the decline of the cassette format in the mid 2000s.
